after 100 to buy a ARM Macbook for my award.

It is important for me to sleep enough.

We decouple **time** in programs from **time** in machines

Atom is a string of characters beginnings with a letter or a special character other than a left '(' or right ')' parenthesis

general vim command

- :e filename, edit file named 'filename'
- :w filename, save a file named 'filename'
- :r filename, read a file name 'filename'
- :q, quit vim
- :! command, exec shell command named 'command'
- :s/old/new, substitute the string 'old' by 'new'
- :help, get vim help


- S, Shift
- C, Control
- D, Command
- M, Meta, Alt


### 95

- The first Commandment, When recurring on a list of atoms, lat, ask two questions about it: `(null? lat)` and else. When recurring on a number, n, ask two questions abount it: `(zero? n)` and else.
- The second Commandment, use `cons` to build lists.
- The forth Commandment, Always change at least one argument while recurring. It must be changed to be closer to termination. The changing argument must be tested in termination condition: when using `cdr`, test termination with `null?` and when using `sub1`, test termination with `zero?`  
- The fifth Commandment, When building a value with `+`, always use 0 for the value of the terminating line, for adding 0 does not change the value of an addition. When building a value with `*`, always use 1 for the value of the terminating line, for multiplying by 1 does not change the value of a multiplitation. When building a value with a `cons`, always consider `'()` for the value of terminating line.

Why use `Cond`? Because we need to ask questions about he actual arguments.
